# Saving high error structures for expanding/improving ML models 

The script 'sticking_prob_save_str.jl' allows saving high error structures, which is enabled by the function 'OutputTrajectory'.

For the script to work properly, several parameters have to be correctly set:
    'save_errors' = true
    'v_models_error' = 0.025 # minimum error (std) between potential energies of multiple models, of the structure that will be saved
    'models_mult_paths' - list of paths to ML models that will be used to predict the values of potential energy
